PART 1 - Containers

The purpose of this project is for you to develop a better understanding of how containers such as
docker work under the hood, and what levels of isolation such containers can provide. As such, you will
construct a container that will run a (somewhat) isolated program inside.
 I created an executable that constructs a container and runs a program within the
container.

PART 2 - Sockets

The goal in this part of the assignment is for you to open a socket between a server and a client.
i created an executable which based on command line arguments will run either a client or
server at a port given at the command line argument.
The server will execute terminal commands that the client passes to it through the socket.
After compilation i have an executable file sockets that can be run as follows:
./sockets client <port> <terminal_command_to_run>
./sockets server <port>
