Q1:

One general use of Linux pid namespaces is setting a New Process IDs Namespace,
independently of what assigned before (CLONE_NEWPID).
From the parent's process perspective, the child's PID will be PARENT_PID.1 ,
but the PID of the offspring process will be assigned to 1.

Q2:

Creating a separate mount namespace allows each of these isolated processes to have a completely different
view of the entire system's mountpoint structure from the original one.
This allows you to have a different root for each isolated process,
as well as other mountpoints that are specific to those processes.


Q3:

Cgroup defines what the container can do. One general use of Linux cgroups is limiting usage of network bandwidth.

Q4:

Clone system call create a new ("child") process, in a manner similar to fork.
This system call, by contrast with fork, provide more precise control over what pieces of execution
context are shared between the calling process and the child process.  For example,
using clone system call, the caller can control whether or not the two processes share
the virtual address space and the table of file descriptors.

Q5:

Every process/command in Linux/Unix like systems has a current working directory called root directory.
chroot is changes the root directory for currently running processes as well as its child processes, to that specified in path.

Q6:
The procfs provides a method of communication between kernel space and user space.
For example, the GNU version of the process reporting utility ps uses the proc file system to obtain its data,
without using any specialized system calls.
